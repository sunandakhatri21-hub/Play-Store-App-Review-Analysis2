        "- High subjectivity scores often correlate with both very positive and very negative polarities, suggesting emotional or opinion-heavy feedback.\n",

        "\n",
        "- For Developers: Focus on negative sentiment analysis to identify and fix common user complaints.\n",

        "- For Marketing Teams: Highlight positive sentiment trends in promotional content.\n",
